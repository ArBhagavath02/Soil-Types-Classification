# Soil Type Classification using Python

## Introduction
This project focuses on classifying soil types using a Python-based machine learning model. Soil classification is essential for understanding the properties and usability of the soil in agricultural and construction applications. The model developed classifies soil into three categories: **Gravel**, **Sand**, and **Silt**, based on specific input features.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a model that can classify different soil types and provide their composition in terms of percentage. The model outputs:
- Percent Gravel
- Percent Sand
- Percent Silt
- Time taken for classification

## Methodology

1. **Dataset**: 
   - The dataset used contains samples representing three types of soil: Gravel, Sand, and Silt.
   - The features considered include properties like [mention the relevant features, if applicable].
  
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Missing values were handled by [describe any preprocessing steps if applicable].
   - The data was normalized or scaled to ensure that all features were within the same range [if applicable].

3. **Model Selection**:
   - A [mention the model type, e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, SVM, etc.] was selected based on its suitability for classification tasks.
   - Hyperparameters were tuned to optimize the model's performance.

4. **Training and Testing**:
   - The data was split into training and testing sets in a [mention the ratio, e.g., 80-20, 70-30] ratio.
   - The model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data to measure its accuracy.

5. **Model Performance**:
   - The model successfully classifies soil types with the following output for a test sample:
     - **Percent Gravel**: 100.0%
     - **Percent Sand**: 0.0%
     - **Percent Silt**: 0.0%
     - **Time to classify**: 1.03427 seconds

## Results
The model was able to classify the soil types accurately based on the input features. The performance was measured by evaluating the percentage composition of each soil type in the test data. The time taken for classification was approximately **1.03427 seconds**, demonstrating the modelâ€™s efficiency in real-time predictions.

## Conclusion
This soil classification model provides an effective solution for identifying soil types based on specific characteristics. By improving soil analysis, it can potentially assist in agricultural decisions, such as crop selection and soil treatment, as well as other domains like civil engineering. Future work can involve expanding the dataset to include more soil types and further improving the model's accuracy through advanced techniques.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset to include more soil types.
- Improve model performance using advanced algorithms.
- Implement real-time data collection for dynamic soil analysis.
